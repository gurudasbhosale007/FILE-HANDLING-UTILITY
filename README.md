As part of my Java internship at CodTech, I worked on Task 1, which required me to develop a Java program that could read, write, and modify text files. This task was essential in helping me understand the fundamentals of file handling in Java, which is a crucial concept in software development. Java provides several built-in classes for handling files, such as File, FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, and PrintWriter, which I utilized to implement efficient file operations. The main objective of this task was to build a file utility program that could seamlessly perform these operations while ensuring data integrity and efficient resource management.
To begin with, I implemented the functionality to read data from a file using the BufferedReader class. This allowed the program to open a text file, read its contents line by line, and display the information on the console. This step was crucial in understanding how Java interacts with external files and how exception handling plays a role in preventing crashes due to missing or inaccessible files. The next step was to implement writing data to a file, where I used the FileWriter class to append new content without erasing the existing text. This ensured that the file retained previous data while allowing users to add new information dynamically. Finally, I incorporated the modification functionality, which involved reading the fileâ€™s contents, making necessary changes, and then writing the modified data back into the file. This required working with temporary files and replacing specific text within the file, ensuring the updated information was accurately stored without corrupting the original data structure.
This task significantly improved my understanding of Java I/O operations, exception handling, and file manipulation techniques. It also reinforced the importance of resource management, as handling files improperly can lead to memory leaks and resource exhaustion. By implementing these features, I gained practical experience in dealing with real-world scenarios where file handling is used for log management, data storage, and content processing systems. Successfully completing this task provided me with a strong foundation in Java file handling, preparing me for more advanced programming challenges in my internship.
